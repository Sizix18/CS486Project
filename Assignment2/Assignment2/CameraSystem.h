//Camera Control: the user must be able to direct the gaze direction of the camera using the mouse and move within
//the world using the forward and backward arrow keys on the keyboard. (the left and right arrow key are not used.)
//Directing the gaze works as an inverted trackball, as we have discussed in class.
//In this exercise, we will replicate a trackball by using the mouse pointer to grab a hold of the bounding sphere of
//the scene and map the mouseâ€™s motion to an angle-axis rotation. In turn, the angle-axis is represented as a quaternion
//and combined with any existing modeling transformations.
//For students who have little to no experience with virtual trackballs, the paper titled Virtual Trackballs Revisited
//by Henriksen et al. ___ is an excellent survey on the topic. Additionally, the required textbook covers quaternions in
//sufficient depth to complete this assignment.
